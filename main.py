#Project Pairs Project
#. import random
#. define a function to store list
#. list should be named 'deck'
#. insert in the list each one of the required elements 
#. create a for loop and range to execute the cycle four times and get four elements of each
#. define a function to shuffle list
#. use random.shuffle(mylist) to mix elements
#. define a function to give cards to players
#. create four new lists, one for each player
#. use a for loop to to give 5 cards to each player
#. update the shuffled deck after a card has been given to assign only remaining cards and avoid repetition
#. research how to find duplicated elements in lists for each player 
#. printto display -> player number, their hand and number of pairs
#. compare number of pairs of each player. Display if there is a winner with the highest number of pairs or if there are tied players
